<p><p>The story so far</p>
<p>I've installed nodejs on my Mac Mini Home server as well as 11ty
and created this blog following along with a Youtube video.</p>
<p>There were some typos I made following in the second video which took some time debugging, but all is well now and the second post is up</p>
